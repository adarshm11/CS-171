They look at you perplexed so you eloborate: \"you know, feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks\". They look even more perplexed. Start by explaining to them what a neural network is in two sentences."

In a neural network, calculations are made in nodes of the model called \"neurons\", and these layers of neurons are passed to successive layers, with each layer contributing toward the final result."

    "CNNs are neural networks that make use of patterns in neighboring pixels to make calculations and predictions on image data. RNNs are neural networks that make use of patterns in consecutive portions of data (often text) to make predictions about what data would follow (e.g. predicting the next word in a sentence). Both of these networks differ from regular neural networks because they analyze much more complex patterns in data, and therefore require not just a higher level of data preprocessing but also a different neural network structure in order to process the data.
