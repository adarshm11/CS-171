    "Supervised learning is when the ML model is given labeled data and is able to learn the data by knowing what should be identified as what. One example of this is when we trained the CNN to classify characters from SpongeBob; in this case, the training data had labels of which animal each picture represented. Unsupervised learning, however, does not include the labels, so the model has to learn the characteristics of the data and make its predictions on its own. This was used in the k-means clustering example, where the data just contains points, which are not labeled, and has to create clusters based on the centroids."

    "k-Nearest Neighbors generates classifications based on the k nearest points to the current point, determining the label based on the majority classification of those k points. k-Mean Clustering generates classifications based on distance away from k centroid points of the distribution, with each point being assigned to the nearest centroid. K-Nearest Neighbors is supervised, as the model learns from existing classifications to predict the next one, while K-Means clustering is unsupervised since the model does not know any classifications beforehand and must classify all of them on its own."

In a similar sense, with neural networks, we also let our models learn patterns in the data. However, these are fundamentally different approaches for investigating our data.
