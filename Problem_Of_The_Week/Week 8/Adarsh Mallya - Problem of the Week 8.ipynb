    "The architecture of multilayer perceptrons and CNNs are very similar. They both include multiple layers to process the pixels of the images as we get closer and closer to a classification guess. For example, the MLP used to classify MNIST number images used two linear layers, with both layers matched to a sigmoid activation function; similarly, the CNN model used to classify characters from SpongeBob included linear layers and activation functions.

    "The key difference between multilayer perceptrons and CNNs are the fact that CNNs use convolution to both optimize the model's efficiency and its performance. MLPs analyze each pixel individually, while CNNs use a sliding window to gather more insights about the image's features. This was extremely important in the classification of SpongeBob characters, where the angle and lighting of the images was confusing the MLP. The CNN performed much better (although not perfect) in gathering features and predicting the classes of the SpongeBob characters."
